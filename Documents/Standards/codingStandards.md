<h2><li>Breaking rules</li></h2>
If you think that breaking rules listed below improves code readability, break them. However, you should put a comment in code & report it to the team (as it probably means that we need to update this document).

<h2><li>Source file basics</li></h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>File name</b></li>
        The source file name consists of the case-sensitive name of the top-level class it contains (of which there is exactly one), plus the <code>.java</code> extension
        <li><b>File encoding</b></li>
        Source files are encoded in UTF-8
        <li><b>Whitespace characters</b></li>
        Aside from the line terminator sequence, the ASCII horizontal space character <code>0x20</code> is the only whitespace character that appears anywhere in a source file
        <li><b>Tab character</b></li>
        Tab should be equal to 4 spaces
        <li><b>Non-ASCII characters</b></li>
        For the remaining non-ASCII characters, either the actual Unicode character (e.g. âˆž) or the equivalent Unicode escape (e.g. `\u221e`) is used - use whatever is easier to read/understand (examples: <a href="http://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s2.3.3-non-ascii-characters">Google standards</a>)
    </ol>
<h2><li>Source file structure</li></h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Order</b></li>
        A source file consists of, <u>in order</u>:
        <ul>
            <li>License or copyright information, if present</li>
            <li>Package statement</li>
            <li>Import statements</li>
            <li>Exactly one top-level class</li>
        </ul>

        Exactly one blank line separates each section that is present

        <li><b>Package & import statements</b></li>
        Package & import statement are not line-wrapped.

        <li><b>Class declaration</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Each top-level class resides in a source file of its own</li>
            <li>Never split constructors (if there are multiple), or multiple methods with the same name, these appear sequentially, with no other code in between (not even private members)</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
<h2><li>Formatting</li></h2>

</ol>
