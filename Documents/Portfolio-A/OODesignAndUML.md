Each user is certified through the University's Single Sign-on. Once done, their information is passed on 
to our application, and they interact with web pages to input students' marks. This data is then stored in 
our database.

Our database can be pushed through into an Excel spreadsheet which CELFS can then pull into their internal 
MS Access database.
