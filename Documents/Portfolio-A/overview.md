Streamlining Marks at CELFS
===========================
- Sector: Education

- Client: Hannah Gurr, teacher at CELFS

The client wants to enhance their current marking system by digitalising it in time for the summer course. 
Currently, teachers are using a table of criteria for marking the essays, after which they calculate the final mark by hand. This information would then be entered into a shared spreadsheet. This causes a high chance for human error., which can be reduced by automating parts of the system, especially the ones concerning the calculation of the final grade from the different bands of criteria.

We aim to provide a website where teachers can input the marks for the different criteria, and have the final marks automatically calculated and stored in a database. This database will then be pulled into a spreadsheet, which can be fed into CELFS' existing Access database. By validating the user input and automating the calculations, we aim to reduce the unnecessarily high human error.
