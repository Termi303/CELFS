Streamlining Marks at CELFS
===========================
- Sector: Education

- Client: Hannah Gurr, teacher at CELFS

The client is after a digital process to replace at least part of their current marking system in time for the summer course. 
Up until now, they've been marking exams by hand, using a table of criteria and calculating the marks by hand. Teachers would then 
input this into a shared spreadsheet, but this led to significant human error which they're keen to avoid. Ease of use is key, 
especially in regards to calculating the grade from the different bands of criteria.

We aim to provide a website where teachers can input the criteria directly, and have the marks automatically calculated and stored 
in a database. This database will then be pulled into a spreadsheet, which can be fed into CELFS' existing Access database. By 
automating the calculations and forcing the user to confirm the criteria they choose, this will reduce human error.
