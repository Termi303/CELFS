BAND ;TASK FULFILMENT & CONTENT (40);LANGUAGE USE & STYLE (20);TEXT ORGANISATION & PRESENTATION (40) ;
An exceptional pass goes beyond what has been taught and shows:;•        Rigorous, lucid, creative & original response;•        Full control of a wide variety of sentence structures;•        Writer responsibility is fully met and thesis is outstanding for originality / creativity / elegance;
;•        Rigorous research process elegantly described with originality in purpose and rationale for text selection;•        Sophisticated use of appropriate grammar and punctuation;•        Between paragraphs, lucid organisation and elegant transitions is a pleasure for the reader;
;•        Exceptionally lucid line of reasoning;•        Accurate and sophisticated usage of appropriate vocabulary ;•        Within paragraphs, elegant development of idea;
;•        Exceptional depth of analysis;•        Accurate grammar & punctuation;•        Sophisticated use of a wide variety of cohesive devices;
;•        Exceptionally sophisticated synthesis of sources to develop own argument in an innovative way;•        Elegant academic style throughout;•        Elegant conclusion ;
;;;•        Exemplary presentation and consistent referencing style;
A very good pass is clear, fluent and accurate and should show extensive application of learning;•        Complete, relevant, fairly sophisticated response to task with noticeable quality of ideas  ;•        Very good control of a variety of sentence structures though possibly some inappropriacies;•        Non-specialist audience very well prepared for topic, task and argument: concise, sophisticated thesis with well-placed map explaining order of key points, which is then followed;
;"•        Method: Personalised rationale for 3 appropriate sources given; limitations explained";•        Almost entirely error-free;•        Between paragraphs, logical organisation and transitions achieve natural coherence which aids readability;
;•        Results: Clear writer’s stance on relative contribution of texts is evident in visualisation and sustained throughout text;•        Very good use of noun phrase for conciseness;•        Within paragraphs, general specific and given new pattern aids flow of ideas across sentences;
;•        Discussion: Very good level of critical analysis of sources demonstrated in main points made but some opportunities to add own voice may still be missed;•        Sufficient range of vocabulary to allow some flexibility and precision including successful use of AWL;•        Effective use of  variety of cohesive devices;
;•        Effective synthesis of summarised key points from different perspectives into own voice ;•        Accurate word choice and form though possibly some inappropriacies;•        Effective conclusion ending with personalised future focus ;
;•        Explicit line of reasoning on development of topic knowledge (beyond basic similarities and differences);•        Appropriate academic style throughout;•        Very good presentation (as 60s plus informative title, caption);
A good pass should be generally clear and accurate though there may be some gaps and errors in application of learning ;•        No major omissions and mostly relevant response to task but may lack sophistication;•        Control of a variety of sentence structures ;•        Non-specialist audience well prepared for topic and task: rationale for choice, key definitions, thesis, purpose and map;
;"•        Method: Basic criteria for selection of most sources mentioned (what and why: CRAAP); limitations acknowledged";"•        Errors with grammar are limited / superficial and meaning is clear; Good punctuation aids readability";•        Between paragraphs, mostly logical organisation presents little difficulty for reader but transitions could be improved;
;•        Results: clear summary supported by visualisation of relationship between three articles on topic (stance);•        Mostly successful use of noun phrase grammar;•        Within paragraphs, mostly clear development of one main idea per paragraph from general to specific ;
;•        Discussion: Clear evidence of understanding through ability to analyse and compare/contrast key points;•        Vocabulary mostly appropriate to the task set including mostly successful use of AWL;•        Mostly successful use of a variety of cohesive devices though  some faulty or mechanical cohesion ;
;•        Emerging ability to synthesise sources in support of own voice, without significant borrowing from sources;•        Few errors in word choice or form and meaning is clear;•        Relevant conclusion ending with a standard future focus;
;•        Line of reasoning may lack sophistication ;•        Appropriate academic style quite well sustained so overall effect is achieved;•        Good presentation (as 50s plus alphabetical references, IMRD headings);
A satisfactory pass is patchy/clumsy with some significant errors. A risk taker with some successful attempts to apply learning.;•        No major omissions with some successful attempts to communicate main ideas but some repetition, irrelevance ;•        Control of simple sentence structures with some successful attempts at variety;•        Thesis easily located but lacks clarity on the relationship between texts and/or how this will be explained (no map) and/or purpose given too late so initial confusion caused;
;•        Method: Narrates use of bibliography & citing authors to select two further sources from original article (what but not why);"•        Some errors with grammar start to hinder meaning in parts; Control of basic punctuation with some successful attempts at complexity";•        Between paragraphs, unexpected organisation presents some difficulty for reader in places and some transitions lacking;
;•        Results: Some evidence of textual and visual summary to show understanding of perspectives of different texts, though perhaps no link between visual and text and/or no explicit stance on relationship;•        Evidence of some successful use of noun phrase grammar;•        Within paragraphs, some successful attempts to develop one main idea per paragraph but  lacks consistency and may diverge from general to specific at times;
;•        Discussion: Some ability to identify key points;•        Some successful attempts to use appropriate vocabulary including AWL;•        Some successful attempts to connect and develop main ideas using cohesive devices;
;•        Over-reliance on borrowing, so voice often  missing;•        Some errors in word choice or form but meaning is clear;•        Attempted conclusion not fully successful;
;•        Some successful attempts to build a basic line of reasoning drawing on sources but not sustained;•        Some successful attempts at academic style;•        Satisfactory presentation (line spacing, alignment, font);
A borderline pass is adequate but limited and muddled.;•        Minimal response to task, with only one major omission (missing one IMRD section, missing source, no reference list, no visual summary);•        Control of basic sentence structure but attempts at variety more unsuccessful than not;•        Research question shows topic focus but thesis is not easily located and it is unclear how the question will be answered (no purpose);
Attempts to apply learning are still unsuccessful more often than not.;•        Method: Poorly selected sources with no explanatory rationale;"•        Grammatical errors hinder retrieval of meaning; Control of basic punctuation but attempts at variety more unsuccessful than not";•        Between paragraphs, basic headings are all that enable the reader to follow the overall text, though with some effort within sections due to lack of writer responsibility for paragraphing;
It  must include:;•        Results: Very limited evidence of summary at level of concepts with no visual support so stance is difficult to discern;•        Relies mainly on verb phrase grammar so wordy;•       Within paragraphs, lack of unity so not everything relates to one main idea and paragraphs tend to ramble;
;•        Discussion: Attempts to communicate main ideas are unsuccessful more often than not with substantial repetition, irrelevance and/or lack of support;•        Limited vocabulary reasonably appropriate to the task set ;•        Limited successful use of cohesive devices ;
;•        Significant borrowing from sources, voice is missing;•        Frequent errors in word choice or form may cause difficulty for the reader;•        Limited conclusion with questionable relevance to argument presented e.g. new ideas introduced;
;•        Few successful attempts to build a line of reasoning;•        Academic style is inconsistent ;•        Muddled presentation (different fonts, different spacing);
A borderline fail  (36) is inadequate and does not show application of learning.;•        Inadequate response to task which misses more than one major element of task;•        Basic sentence structure is sound but no attempt at variety  ;•        Topic has not been narrowed to research question;
It could include:;•        Neither what nor why is covered in the method section;•        Errors predominate in punctuation and grammar so meaning is often distorted ;•        Lack of writer responsibility for choice of effective organisation (not even basic IMRD headings) and lack of transitions cause notable difficulties for the reader throughout the text ;
;•        Writer’s stance difficult to identify ;•        Basic vocabulary used repetitively and often inappropriate to the task;•       Serious inadequacies in paragraphing;
;•        Substantially irrelevant;•        Stylistic variation is largely uncontrolled with little evidence of academic style;•        Very limited range of cohesive devices often used unsuccessfully;
;•        Sources used wholly inappropriately;;•        Conclusion bears no resemblance to introduction or body of text;
;•        Any attempt to build a line of reasoning is unsuccessful;;;
29/22 Fail;•        A mixture of elements from 1& 2;;;
;•        Fails to address the general scope of the task;•        Little evidence of basic sentence structure;•        No attempt to introduce topic or draw conclusions;
A clear fail (15/7) is poor ;•        Focus can be perceived only with difficulty;•        Basic errors in grammar and punctuation predominate obstructing meaning;•        No sections ;
;•        No attempt to build a line of reasoning;•        Frequent poor word choice or form obscures meaning ;•        No attempt at paragraphing ;
;•        No discernible attempt to establish stance;•        No evidence of academic style;•        No logical coherence ;
;•        Sources not used;;•        No attempt at even basic cohesion;
;;;•        Inadequate presentation ;
0;•        No attempt at task;•        Incomprehensible due to lack of control of structure or word choice/form;•        No awareness of academic conventions is evidenced;
