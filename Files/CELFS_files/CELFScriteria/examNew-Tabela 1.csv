BAND ;An exceptional pass goes beyond what has been taught and shows:;A very good pass is clear, fluent and accurate and should show extensive application of learning;A good pass should be generally clear and accurate though there may be some gaps and errors in application of learning;A satisfactory pass is patchy/clumsy with some significant errors.
