Stakeholders
============
- Ms Hannah Gurr: Hannah is the one who proposed the project, and is our primary source of contact with the CELFS. She will ulitmately dictate what we will implement, and as a teacher she has the most knowledge about how the website will be used to mark courseworks and exams.
- Other Teaching Staff: They will use the website to mark coursework and exams as well, so it is imperative that it meets their requirements.
- Admin Staff: They are responsible for handling the marks once they have been submitted and releasing them to the student cohort. Additionally, the admin staff handle double marking, late penalties and such, and they liase with the wider University. As such, it is important we build a system they can use.
- Students: The website will be used to mark students' courseworks and exams, so they will be heavily invested in the robustness and reliability of the system.
- The University of Bristol: The University will admit students onto its courses based on the results of their foundation year. Additionally, as the database will store student information, we will have to comply with the University data protection regulations.
