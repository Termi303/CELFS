;•        Analysis: shows depth ;•        Sophisticated use of appropriate grammar and punctuation;•        Thesis outstanding for originality / creativity;;;;;;
;•        Evaluation: insightful interim and final comments;•        Accurate grammar & punctuation ;•        Between paragraphs, lucid organisation and elegant transitions is a pleasure for the reader;;;;;;
;•        Synthesis: evidence of reading/listening beyond set texts;•        Accurate and sophisticated usage of appropriate vocabulary including successful use of AWL;•        Within paragraphs, elegant development of idea;;;;;;
;;•        Elegant academic style throughout;•        Sophisticated use of a wide variety of cohesive devices;;;;;;
A very good pass is clear, fluent and accurate and should show extensive application of learning;•        Response: question is very effectively addressed;•        Very good control of a variety of sentence structures though possibly some inappropriacies;•        Fairly sophisticated overall structure;;;;;;
;•        Understanding: concepts/ issue/theories clearly understood;•        Almost entirely error-free;•        Fairly sophisticated thesis at start of answer;;;;;;
;•        Analysis: a range of perspectives considered;•        Very good use of noun phrase for conciseness;•        Between paragraphs, logical organisation and transitions achieve natural coherence which aids readability;;;;;;
;•        Evaluation: very appropriate interim and final comments;•        Sufficient range of vocabulary to allow some flexibility and precision including successful use of AWL;•        Within paragraphs, general specific and given new pattern aids flow of ideas across sentences;;;;;;
;•        Synthesis: very effective use of reading / lecture input on British context and other contexts considered;•        Accurate word choice and form though possibly some inappropriacies;•        Effective use of  variety of cohesive devices;;;;;;
;;•        Appropriate academic style throughout;;;;;;;
A good pass should be generally clear and accurate though there may be some gaps and errors in application of learning;•        Response: question is fully addressed ;•        Control of a variety of sentence structures ;•        Clear overall structure ;;;;;;
;•        Understanding: concepts/issue/theories mostly clearly understood;•        Errors with grammar are limited / superficial and meaning is clear;•        Clear thesis at start of answer;;;;;;
;•        Analysis: mostly successful use of relevant supporting ideas for points made;•        Good punctuation aids readability;•        Between paragraphs, mostly logical organisation presents little difficulty for reader;;;;;;
;•        Evaluation: mostly successful interim and final comments;•        Mostly successful use of noun phrase grammar;•        Within paragraphs, mostly clear development of one main idea per paragraph from general to specific ;;;;;;
;•        Synthesis: mostly successful use of reading and lecture input on British context;•        Vocabulary mostly appropriate to the task set including mostly successful use of AWL;•        Mostly successful use of a variety of cohesive devices though  some errors (grammatical connectors);;;;;;
;;•        Few errors in word choice or form and meaning is clear;;;;;;;
;;•        Appropriate academic style quite well sustained so overall effect is achieved;;;;;;;
A satisfactory pass is patchy/clumsy with some significant errors. A risk taker with some successful attempts to apply learning.;•        Response: question is partially addressed;•        Control of simple sentence structures with some successful attempts at variety;•        Some overall structure;;;;;;
;•        Understanding: some evidence of issues/theories raised in course;•        Some errors with grammar start to hinder meaning in parts ;•        Attempted thesis at start but lacks clarity on stance;;;;;;
;•        Analysis: Some evidence of relevant ideas to support points made;•        Control of basic punctuation with some successful attempts at complexity;•        Between paragraphs, patchy organisation/faulty transitions present some difficulty for reader in places;;;;;;
;•        Evaluation: Some successful evaluative comments, but patchy;•        Evidence of some successful use of noun phrase grammar;•        Within paragraphs, some successful attempts to develop one main idea per paragraph but may diverge from general to specific ;;;;;;
;•        Synthesis: some successful attempts to acknowledge reading or lecture input on British context;•        Some successful attempts to use appropriate vocabulary including AWL;•        Some successful attempts to connect ideas using cohesive devices (grammatical connectors);;;;;;
;;•        Some errors in word choice or form but meaning is retrievable;;;;;;;
;;•        Some successful attempts at academic style;;;;;;;
A borderline pass is adequate but limited and muddled. Attempts to apply learning are still unsuccessful more often than not. It  must include:;•        Minimal response to the task. ;•         Control of basic sentence structure but attempts at variety more unsuccessful than not;•        Basic overall structure in evidence though not always signalled through clear paragraphing ;;;;;;
;•        Some inaccurate or muddled understanding of issues/theories;•        Grammatical errors hinder retrieval of meaning ;•        Thesis difficult to locate or left until conclusion;;;;;;
;•        Attempts to support points made more unsuccessful than not;•        Control of basic punctuation but attempts at variety more unsuccessful than not;•        Between paragraphs, some basic organisation enables the reader to follow the text, though with some effort due to missing transitions;;;;;;
;•        Attempts at evaluative comment more unsuccessful than not;•        Relies mainly on verb phrase grammar so wordy;•       Within paragraphs, some lapses in unity so not everything relates to one main idea;;;;;;
;•        Inconsistent acknowledgement and/or inaccurate use of reading / lecture input on British context ;•        Limited vocabulary reasonably appropriate to the task set;•        Limited successful use of cohesive devices;;;;;;
;;•        Frequent errors in word choice or form may cause difficulty for the reader;;;;;;;
;;•        Academic style is inconsistent;;;;;;;
A borderline fail  (36) is inadequate and does not show application of learning. It could include:;•        Inadequate response to task (too short);•        Basic sentence structure is sound but no attempt at variety  ;•        Serious problems with overall structure;;;;;;
;•        Mostly inaccurate understanding of issue or theory;•        Errors predominate in punctuation and grammar so meaning is often distorted ;•        No thesis (only purpose statement);;;;;;
;•        Substantially irrelevant points with little support;•        Basic vocabulary used repetitively and often inappropriate to the task;•       Ineffective organisation and lack of transitions cause notable difficulties for the reader ;;;;;;
;•        Little attempt at evaluation;•        Stylistic variation is largely uncontrolled with little evidence of academic style;•       Serious inadequacies in paragraphing;;;;;;
;•        No acknowledgement or use of reading / lecture input on British context;;•       Very limited range of cohesive devices often used unsuccessfully;;;;;;
29/22 Fail;•        A mixture of elements from 1& 2;;;;;;;;
A clear fail (15/7) is poor ;•        Fails to address the general scope of the title;•        Little evidence of basic sentence structure;•        Overall structure not discernible;;;;;;
;•        Focus can be perceived only with difficulty.;•        Basic errors in grammar and punctuation predominate obstructing meaning;•        No thesis nor purpose;;;;;;
;•        No attempt to analyse ;•        Frequent poor word choice or form obscures meaning ;•        Confusing organisation, with logical coherence frequently not sustained even at a basic level ;;;;;;
;•        No attempt to evaluate;No evidence of academic style;•        No paragraphing ;;;;;;
;•        No attempt to synthesise;;;;;;;;
0;•        No attempt at task;•        Incomprehensible due to lack of control of structure or word choice/form.;•        Logical coherence absent.;;;;;;
;•        Evidence of cheating;;;;;;;;
